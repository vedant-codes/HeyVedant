## 💻 About Me

I’m a curious and driven Computer Science student who’s passionate about solving real-world problems through efficient, scalable software. I’ve always been a good student, but what really excites me is **problem-solving** and **building things from scratch**.

Whether it’s optimizing a graph algorithm, designing a GUI, or deploying a full-stack app—I love the entire process of turning an idea into a working product.
